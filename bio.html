    <h2>About Me</h2>

        <img src="placeimg_640_480_nature (1).jpg" alt="Wooded Landscape" style="width:260px;height:200px;" class="float-img">
        <p>Currently I am a Project Manager II, with experience managing projects and also acting as a business analyst for consumer packaged goods, medical and pharmaceutical clients.
            Prior to my current posistion I held a dual role as an administrator for SAP and the sole resource for managing the SAP MM module, used for purchasing goods and services globally.
            I have also worked as a help desk analyst.</p>

        <p>I have always loved technology and enjoyed jobs where that was my focus.  Learning and improving upon existing skills has also been of paramount importance.  
            I was able to combine both passions when I decided to learn full stack web developement.</p>

        <p>My attention to detail, organizational skills, investment in learning and interpersonal skills have served me well in every position I have held.
            As an SAP administrator and MM module SME, I had unique insight into not only the system as a whole, but also end user processes.  
            This allowed me to troubleshoot, streamline specific functions and provide training to all users.</p>

        <p>As a current student learning full stack web development, I look forward to returning to my technology roots and transitioning into a new and rewarding career.</p>
